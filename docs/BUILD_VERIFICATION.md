# Taverna Build Verification
Each release includes a `checksums.txt` generated by the build system that can be used to verify the checksum
of individual release artifacts.

Artifact signature attestations are provided with each build. In order to verify an artifact the `gh` command
from [GitHub](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases) is required along with the `attestation.json` file from the release and the release
artifact itself. The checksum.txt file is also attested to verify the provenance of that file.
```shell
# for release 1.2 linux-amd64 build
gh attestation verify -R chrisruffalo/taverna -b attestation.json taverna-1.2-linux-amd64 
```
For a target image the process is similar but requires a login to GitHub first.
```shell
gh auth login
gh attestation verify -R chrisruffalo/taverna oci://docker.io/chrisruffalo/taverna:1.2
```
The main difference between this and a checksum file or image digest is that this proves that the file came from the GitHub build system and
was not replaced (along with the checksum file) for malicious purposes. Some of this may sound like overkill but this release
